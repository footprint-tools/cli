WORKFLOW

fp runs invisibly in the background. Once set up, it automatically
records your git activity without any extra steps.

GETTING STARTED

    1. Go to a repository you want to track:
       $ cd /path/to/your/repo

    2. Install the hooks:
       $ fp setup

    That's it! Every commit, merge, checkout, and rebase in this repo
    will now be recorded automatically.

    Setup also installs shell completions for tab-completion of fp
    commands. See 'fp help configuration' for manual setup.

    Repeat for each repository you want to track.

DAILY USAGE

After setup, fp works silently. Check your activity anytime:

    $ fp activity           # See recent activity across all repos
    $ fp activity -n 50     # See more entries
    $ fp repos              # List all tracked repositories
    $ fp repos check        # Verify hooks are installed in current repo

REAL-TIME MONITORING

Watch events as they happen:

    $ fp watch              # Stream events live (Ctrl+C to stop)
    $ fp watch -i           # Interactive view with stats

STAYING UP TO DATE

Check your version and update when needed:

    $ fp version             # Show installed version
    $ fp update              # Download and install latest release

Updates automatically reinstall shell completions.

MENTAL MODEL

Think of fp as a private activity diary. Every git action in a
tracked repo creates an entry. All data stays on your machine.
