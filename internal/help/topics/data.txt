DATA

fp records metadata about your git activity. It does NOT store file
contents, diffs, or your actual code.

WHAT GETS RECORDED

For each git event:

    - When it happened (timestamp)
    - What type (commit, merge, checkout, rebase, push)
    - Which repository (identified by its remote URL)
    - Commit hash (when applicable)
    - Branch name (when applicable)

WHERE DATA IS STORED

Events go into a SQLite database:

    Linux:  ~/.config/Footprint/store.db
    macOS:  ~/Library/Application Support/Footprint/store.db

VIEWING YOUR DATA

    $ fp activity         # See recent events
    $ fp activity -n 100  # See more
    $ fp watch            # See events in real time

DATA RETENTION

fp keeps all events forever. The database grows over time but stays
small (commits are just metadata). Delete the database file to reset.

AUTOMATIC CSV EXPORT

Events are also exported to CSV files with extra details like commit
messages and line counts. Exports run automatically every hour.

Export location:

    Linux:  ~/.config/Footprint/exports/
    macOS:  ~/Library/Application Support/Footprint/exports/

CSV files rotate by year:

    commits.csv          This year's events
    commits-2025.csv     Last year's events
    commits-2024.csv     Older events

CSV COLUMNS

Each row contains:

    authored_at      When the commit was authored
    repo             Repository identifier
    branch           Branch name
    commit           Full commit hash
    subject          First line of commit message
    author           Author name
    author_email     Author email
    files            Number of files changed
    additions        Lines added
    deletions        Lines removed
    parents          Parent commit hashes
    committer        Committer name
    committer_email  Committer email
    committed_at     When recorded by fp
    source           How it was recorded (post-commit, backfill, etc.)
    machine          Computer hostname

SYNC TO A REMOTE

Back up your exports to a git remote:

    $ fp config set export_remote git@github.com:you/my-exports.git

fp will push CSV updates to this remote automatically.
