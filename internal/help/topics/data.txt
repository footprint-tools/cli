DATA

fp records metadata about git events. It does not store file contents,
diffs, or commit messages.

WHAT IS RECORDED

For each event:
    - Timestamp (when the event occurred)
    - Event type (commit, merge, checkout, rebase, push)
    - Repository ID (derived from remote URL or local path)
    - Commit SHA (when applicable)
    - Branch name (when applicable)

STORAGE LOCATION

Events are stored in a SQLite database at:
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Footprint/store.db

On most systems this resolves to:
    ~/.config/Footprint/store.db

On macOS:
    ~/Library/Application Support/Footprint/store.db

REPOSITORY IDENTIFICATION

Repositories are identified by a hash of their primary remote URL
(usually 'origin'). This means:
    - The same repo cloned to different paths shares one ID
    - Repos without remotes use a hash of the local path
    - Changing remotes requires 'fp sync-remote' to update the ID

VIEWING DATA

    $ fp activity         # Human-readable event list
    $ fp activity -n 100  # Show more entries

DATA RETENTION

fp does not automatically delete old events. The database will grow
over time. You can manually delete the database file to reset.

EXPORT TO CSV

Events are automatically exported to CSV files with enriched metadata.
Exports run periodically (default: every hour) after recording events.

Export location:
    ~/.config/Footprint/exports/          (Linux)
    ~/Library/Application Support/Footprint/exports/  (macOS)

CSV structure (year-based rotation):
    commits.csv          Current year's events
    commits-2024.csv     Events from 2024
    commits-2023.csv     Events from 2023

CSV COLUMNS

Each exported row contains (in order):

    authored_at      When the author made the commit (RFC3339)
    repo             Repository identifier
    branch           Branch name
    commit           Full commit hash (40 chars)
    subject          First line of commit message
    author           Commit author name
    author_email     Commit author email
    files            Number of files modified
    additions        Lines added
    deletions        Lines removed
    parents          Parent commit hashes (space-separated)
    committer        Committer name
    committer_email  Committer email
    committed_at     When the event was recorded (RFC3339)
    source           Event source (post-commit, backfill, etc.)
    machine          Hostname where the commit was recorded

SYNC TO REMOTE

Configure a remote to automatically push exports:

    $ fp config set export_remote git@github.com:user/exports.git

The export directory is a git repository. Each export creates a commit
and pushes to the configured remote if available.
