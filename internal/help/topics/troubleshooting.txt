TROUBLESHOOTING

Common issues and how to fix them.

HOOKS NOT RUNNING

If fp doesn't record events after commits:

    1. Check if hooks are installed:
       $ fp repos check

    2. Re-install hooks if needed:
       $ fp setup

    3. Make sure you're in the right directory (the repo root).

NO EVENTS SHOWING UP

If 'fp activity' shows nothing:

    1. Verify hooks are installed:
       $ fp repos check

    2. Make a test commit and check again:
       $ git commit --allow-empty -m "test"
       $ fp activity

    3. If the repo existed before fp, import old commits:
       $ fp backfill

MISSING HISTORICAL EVENTS

To import commits made before fp was installed:

    $ fp backfill                    # Import all past commits
    $ fp backfill --since 2025-01-01 # Import from specific date
    $ fp backfill --limit 100        # Import last 100 commits

Note: backfill only imports commits, not merges or checkouts.

VIEWING LOGS

Enable logging to debug issues:

    $ fp config set enable_log true
    $ fp logs --tail                 # Watch logs in real time

Log location:
    Linux:  ~/.config/Footprint/fp.log
    macOS:  ~/Library/Application Support/Footprint/fp.log

RESETTING DATA

To start fresh:

    1. Remove the database:
       Linux:  rm ~/.config/Footprint/store.db
       macOS:  rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Footprint/store.db

    2. Or just clear logs:
       $ fp logs --clear

HOOKS CONFLICT WITH EXISTING HOOKS

If you already have git hooks:

    1. fp backs them up automatically during setup
    2. Check backup status with: fp repos check
    3. Backups are saved as .git/hooks/*.backup

COMPLETIONS NOT WORKING

If tab-completion stops working after an update:

    1. Reinstall completions:
       $ fp completions

    2. Restart your shell:
       $ exec $SHELL

If you use Zsh and completions never worked:

    1. Add eval line to ~/.zshrc:
       $ echo 'eval "$(fp completions --script)"' >> ~/.zshrc

    2. Restart your shell

STILL HAVING ISSUES

Before reporting a bug, try updating to the latest version:

    $ fp version             # Note your current version
    $ fp update              # Install latest release

If the issue persists, include the output of 'fp version' when
reporting at: https://github.com/footprint-tools/cli/issues
