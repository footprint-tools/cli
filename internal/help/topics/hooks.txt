HOOKS

fp uses git hooks to record events automatically. Once installed,
you don't need to run any commands - fp captures activity silently.

WHAT HOOKS DO

    post-commit     Records each commit you make
    post-merge      Records merges (including git pull)
    post-checkout   Records when you switch branches
    post-rewrite    Records rebases and amended commits
    pre-push        Records push attempts

INSTALLATION OPTIONS

Option 1: Per-repository (recommended for most users)

    $ fp setup                    # Current repo
    $ fp setup ~/projects/myapp   # Specific repo

Option 2: Global via core.hooksPath

    $ fp setup --core-hooks-path

    This sets git's global core.hooksPath. Works for repos WITHOUT
    their own local core.hooksPath setting.

    LIMITATION: Repos with Husky, lefthook, or any local core.hooksPath
    will NOT use the global hooks. Local config always wins.

Option 3: Integration with hook managers (Husky, pre-commit, lefthook)

    If a repo uses Husky, pre-commit, or lefthook, add fp to their hooks:

    Husky (.husky/post-commit):
        fp record post-commit

    pre-commit (.pre-commit-config.yaml):
        - repo: local
          hooks:
            - id: footprint
              entry: fp record post-commit
              stages: [post-commit]

    lefthook (lefthook.yml):
        post-commit:
          commands:
            footprint:
              run: fp record post-commit

WHAT HAPPENS DURING SETUP

    1. fp creates hook scripts in .git/hooks/
    2. If you have existing hooks, they're backed up first
    3. The hooks call 'fp record' which saves events to the database

HOW HOOKS WORK

When you make a commit (or merge, checkout, etc.):

    1. Git runs the appropriate hook
    2. The hook calls 'fp record'
    3. fp saves the event to your local database
    4. That's it - no network calls, no delays

CHECKING HOOK STATUS

    $ fp repos check        # Current repo
    $ fp repos scan         # Scan multiple repos

REMOVING HOOKS

    $ fp teardown                     # Current repo
    $ fp teardown ~/projects/myapp    # Specific repo
    $ fp teardown --core-hooks-path   # Remove global hooks

GIT CONFIG PRIORITY

Git configuration priority (highest to lowest):

    1. Local   (.git/config)      - always wins
    2. Global  (~/.gitconfig)
    3. System  (/etc/gitconfig)

This is why --core-hooks-path doesn't affect repos with local
core.hooksPath settings.
